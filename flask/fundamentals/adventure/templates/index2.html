        A pop of glass opening, bright light seeps inside. A gentle hand the
        length of my body picks me up from under my arms and seats me in a
        dollhouse armchair. I watch as the giant girl in the Facility's uniform
        scrubs her hands in a sink as large as a swimming pool. She is a kind of
        nurse, I think. My wife was a nurse, though in our day, the Facility
        didnâ€™t exist. I am handed a pair of sunglasses while my eyes adjust to
        the natural light.
